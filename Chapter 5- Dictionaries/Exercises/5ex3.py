# Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, 
# clean up the code from Exercise 6-3 (page 99) by replacing your series of print()
# calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. 
# When you’re sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms 
# to your glossary.When you run your program again, these new words 
# and meanings should automatically be included in the output.

'Loop:': '\n Control structure in Python that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.',
