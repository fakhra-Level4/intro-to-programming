# Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.
# * Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.
# * Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
# * Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

for x in Dict.keys():
    print(x)
